# ice-cream

This is a dataset of 2,011 ice cream flavors collected by Anita Johnson's 2017-2018 coding classes at Kealing Middle School in Austin, Texas. The middle schoolers hand-collected these names in April 2018 and are generously allowing me to post them here for the community to use.

A writeup of the project, including the middleschoolers' results from training textgenrnn on this dataset: http://aiweirdness.com/post/173797162852/ai-scream-for-ice-cream

A sequel to the further experiment, in which I trained char-rnn on this dataset: http://aiweirdness.com/post/173990761332/generated-ice-cream-flavors-now-its-my-turn
